# Introduction

Game Theory is an experimental "game" and thought experiment currently in development on the Fantom Opera blockchain. In simple terms, it works like a Tomb/3omb fork mixed with a DeFi Kingdoms fork. Depending on funds raised, it might be used to create a variety of projects, starting with a video game since that is what the dev's background is. THEORY holders will be able to vote on aspects of the game, as well as receive a cut of the revenue (details to be worked out later). GAME might be used as currency within the game(s)/project(s), and the LP providers would earn fees from that (as well as from other promotions).

## Origins

Game Theory was built by an ex-AAA game programmer that was curious about what would happen if a tomb fork had altered tokenomics. After getting into a bunch of tomb forks with a mix of disappointment, excitement, and rugpulls, she decided to make it happen. Since this was her first real decentralized app, she decided to not take it too far for security and financial reasons. The best plan she came up with was to fork the tokenomics of another project. The best tokenomics the dev could think of was DeFi Kingdoms' tokenomics, so she went with that.  She also edited the DeFi Kingdoms structure somewhat for GAME lockups and avoiding the selling of locked tokens.

## Ultimate Goal

This project is a thought-experiment, a fundraiser, and a game of sorts. The goal is for a sustainable protocol that eventually branches out to many things, including games, NFTs, and yield farming.  Check out the roadmap for more info.

Also, I heard that DAI has a liquidity problem, so that might come in handy.
