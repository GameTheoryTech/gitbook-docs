# Introduction

Welcome to Game Theory! Game Theory (GT) is the first seigniorage-gamefi protocol. We are combining the mechanics of a seigniorage protocol, a treasury investment system and NFTs to fund the development of our 2D RPG game **Brutal Network** on the Fantom Opera blockchain.

Inspired by both Tomb Finance, DeFi Kingdoms, and a number of other protocols, GT looks to innovate in the DeFi and GameFi space and provide a long term sustainable platform for its investors.&#x20;

Our platform token $GAME will be in the in-game currency and LP providers will earn fees from the game and other promotions.&#x20;

Our governance token $THEORY are shares that reflect the value of the protocol. Owning $THEORY gives investors a share of the treasury profits and value created by Brutal Network.

Our head developer is a former AAA programmer with extensive experience that wanted to bring something new and innovative to the gaming space and saw GT as the perfect vehicle to achieve that. The goal of the protocol is to bootstrap the liquidity and fundraise for the development and deployment of a next generation RPG game, all the while creating an ecosystem to grow long-term with the Fantom blockchain.
