# Introduction

Welcome to Game Theory! Game Theory (GT) is the first seigniorage-gamefi protocol that combines the best qualities of a seigniorage protocol, a reflection token, a rebase project and NFTs with a 2D RPG that is currently in development on the Fantom Opera blockchain. Inspired by both Tomb Finance, DeFi Kingdoms and a number of other protocols GT looks to innovate in the DeFi and GameFi space and provide a long term sustainable platform for its investors. The seigniorage protocol will help to bootstrap liquidity for the launch of our blockchain game. $GAME will be in the in-game currency and LP providers will earn fees from the game and other promotions. Our head developer is a former AAA programmer with extensive experience that wanted to bring something new and innovative to the gaming space and saw GT as the perfect vehicle to achieve that. The goal of the protocol is to bootstrap the liquidity and fundraise for the development and deployment of a next generation RPG game, all the while creating an ecosystem and the advantage of the potential and growth of the Fantom blockchain.
