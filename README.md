# Introduction

Welcome to Game Theory! Game Theory is building an ecosystem of blockchain games powered by our token $GAME. Our goal is to use the innovation of cryptocurrency to support building truly engaging and innovative games that provide an incredible experience to our users, as well as an opportunity to earn money.&#x20;

Founded by our AAA Game Developer 0xSweetie, Game Theory is developing a string of fun and innovative blockchain games that combine free-to-play mechanisms with play-to-earn elements to give people fun, engaging, and exciting games, along with the opportunity to generate income!

Our first game is Altergene, which is a maze-chase game inspired by classic arcade games. Play as our hero Luna, as you try and avoid the enemies while collecting as many coins as possible to get the highest score! You can collect power ups that provide different abilities to help you defeat the enemies and collect more points. The levels get progressively harder and more you play to keep you on your toes!

The second game in the ecosystem is No Animals Harmed, which is our mobile-friendly projectile game. Attack the enemies and bosses with your projectile animals to progress through each level while collecting points and experience. Upgrade your character avatar as you accumulate points to give your animals a permanent boost. Move through the map to become the ultimate champion!

Our third game will be an expansive turn-based role playing game called Celestial. Celestial is a tactical RPG where you will be able to play as your character and move your way through the world battling enemies and monsters along your journey to become the worlds greatest hero! Play in the world with friends and have the opportunity to earn as your character grows stronger and you complete more quests!

All of our games will be powered by our token $GAME which is the center of our ecosystem. Along with our games we have a decentralized exchange, yield farming, NFTs, an NFT marketplace and a lottery!

Our goal is to become the premier blockchain gaming ecosystem in all of decentralized finance. We are excited to have you along with us on this journey!
