# Introduction

Game Theory (Working Title) is a Futuristic Online Shooter mixed with a 2D role player game. Combat will involve momentum-based maneuvers, such as boosters and grappling hooks. Player v Enemy is the focus. There will also be a player v player storyline. The main player v enemy gameplay is hoard-based gameplay and rouge-like dungeons.

Spirits are special NFT partners that help you in the game. They have varying stats and a random ability.

Crypto integration + revenue is from purchasing items with $GAME, as well as NFT integration.

The game will be also released on Steam, with crypto integration removed. People on Steam would be able to buy fake GAME tokens with fiat, at a premium. They cannot buy NFT-exclusive items.
