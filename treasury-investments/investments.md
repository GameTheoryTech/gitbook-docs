# Investments

Game Theory is in the development phase of building a 2D RPG F2P blockchain game that will revolutionize the space! Developing a game this ambitious will time time and resources and so to support that goal and to bring more value to the community Game Theory will be investing the treasury funds into blockchain gaming.

**Why?**

We are lifelong lovers of gaming which is what inspired Game Theory. We believe in supporting the thriving ecosystem of blockchain gaming and at the same time generating profit for the community and the protocol?

**How?**

We will leverage the power of our community by crowdsourcing investment ideas that will be vetted by the core team and the top proposals will be submitted to the community for a vote. Whatever the community decides will be what the treasury invests in. Initially this will be done via discord before moving onto a more formal snapshot voting system that will be decided by holders of our governance token $THEORY.

**Strategy?**

In the first phase of the protocol launch we will be focused on top tier games that are lower risk to get a consistent return for the community and help to build the treasury funds. As the community and treasury grows we will look to diversify and invest in more medium/higher risk projects, especially projects in development or their early stages of launch that the community is excited to support in order to help other games get off the ground and benefit from the success that they achieve.&#x20;

**Distributing Profits**

The treasury investments will all be publicized on discord so our community can be involved in the entire process. Profits generated from all investments will be split 50/50. 50% of the profits will be distributed to the community with strategic buybacks of $GAME and $THEORY. 50% of the profits will go back into the treasury to enable further investments.&#x20;
