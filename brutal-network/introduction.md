# No Animals Harmed

No Animals Harmed (NAH) is a casual puzzle free-to-play game where the objective is to use your projectile characters to defeat all the enemies on each level on the map including a boss on every map! As you complete a map a new one gets generated and each one gets progressively more difficult! Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible to be the ultimate champion!&#x20;

As you move your way through the levels you are able to accumulate currency that can be used to upgrade your characters. If you lose all your lives you return to the start of the map and your progress is lost! The goal of the game is to generate a high a score as possible and through playing you are able to permanently increase the strength of your characters! Completing increasingly difficult levels also provides a play-to-earn element where you can earn special in-game currency that can be converted to $GAME!&#x20;

NAH is a procedurally generated game meaning every game run will be different from the last one, but the levels will always get more difficult as they are completed. When you complete a level, you will see your progress on the map and you will have the opportunity to go to the in-game store and purchase items or make character upgrades permanent.&#x20;

There are two types of currency: silver and gold. Silver can only be earned through game play and can only be used inside the game. Gold can only be minted with $GAME and can only be used inside the game to purchase certain premium items.&#x20;

When you die on a run you have the option to pay a certain amount of silver or gold to continue playing. You also get the option to use silver or gold to make your skill point earned permanent or you will lose those points forever!&#x20;

Our in-game store will include: new characters, special gear, special skins, different colors, font types and animated effects so you can truly create your own unique group of characters to help you on your journey through the map. &#x20;
