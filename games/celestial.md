# Celestial

Celestial is a tactical role playing game in which players follow the story of the protagonist. The game features two modes of play: battles and the world map. Battles take place on three-dimensional, isometric fields. Characters move on a battlefield composed of square tiles; movement and action ranges are determined by the character's statistics. The battlefield also factors in elements such as terrain and weather to determine strategic advantages and disadvantages during clashes

The world will incorporate battle games with momentum based maneuvers  such as boosters and grappling hooks. Player v Enemy is the focus. There will also be a player v player storyline. The main player v enemy gameplay is hoard-based gameplay and rouge-like dungeons. Spirits are special NFT partners that help you in the game. They have varying stats and a random ability.

Crypto integration + revenue is from purchasing items with $GAME, as well as NFT integration.

The game will be also released on Steam, with crypto integration removed. People on Steam would be able to buy fake GAME tokens with fiat, at a premium. They cannot buy NFT-exclusive items.
