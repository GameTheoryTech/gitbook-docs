# Roadmap

This was created as a simple thought/programming experiment/money game. However, if this blows up for whatever reason, I'll be using the funds to live and build new ventures, mainly video games and more thought experiments, and revenue share with THEORY token holders. Marketing, too. Depending on the money received, the treasury might invest in other things as well, such as farming, real estate, stocks, etc. I will also hire helpers an an audit if I make enough. Most of the money beyond $100k per year will be used to give back to the community and protocol.

Updates will be posted here as the roadmap is updated.  Sprints for the video game will also be posted here when made publicly available.



* [ ] $0 per year (In Progress): Launch protocol and gather suggestions for the protocol and game(s). Should it be crypto-related (adoption/stigma issues in the gaming community)? Should it connect to the blockchain?  NFTs? Multiplayer? How many players? 2D? 3D? Mobile? All this and more will be answered by the community.\
  EDIT: Winning Votes so far: March 22, 2022 Launch Date, Game Genre: 2D Online RPG with crypto integrations
* [ ] $0 per year (In Progress): Start building prototypes for the game and show concepts to the community
* [ ] $100k per year: Pay for Snapshot ENS address for voting purposes. Initiate the majority of the development on the video game. This is the baseline pay for single-dev work on the video game.
* [ ] $200k per year: Hire an artist to help with the video game.
* [ ] $300k+ per year: Hire talented individuals intervals to help with the game.  Programmers (blockchain and not), producers, artists, designers, marketing, HR, partnerships... Whatever we need at the time to get things done!
* [ ] $300k+ per year: Giveaways, charity donations, etc. to market the protocol, help others, and give back to the community!
* [ ] $1M (Not per year. Maybe earlier, maybe later? Depends on the protocol and auditing company.): Audit. We can pay without worrying too much about the health of the protocol.&#x20;
* [ ] $1M per year: It might be time to form a corporation!
* [ ] $2M per year: We could probably do major donations to charities and communities without harming the protocol! Let's do something positive for our communities, crypto and not!
