# Roadmap

Updates will be posted here as the roadmap is updated.  Sprints for the video game will also be posted here when made publicly available.

* [ ] $0 per year: Launch protocol and gather suggestions for the protocol and game(s). Should it be crypto-related (adoption/stigma issues in the gaming community)? Should it connect to the blockchain?  NFTs? Multiplayer? How many players? All this and more will be answered by the community.
* [ ] $100k per year: Pay for Snapshot ENS address for voting purposes. Initiate development on video game. This is the baseline pay for single-dev work on the video game.
* [ ] $200k per year: Hire an artist to help with the video game.
* [ ] $300k+ per year: Hire talented individuals intervals to help with the game.  Programmers (blockchain and not), producers, artists, designers, marketing, HR, partnerships... Whatever we need at the time to get things done!
* [ ] $1M (Not per year. Maybe earlier, maybe later? Depends on the protocol and auditing company.): Audit. We can pay without worrying too much about the health of the protocol.&#x20;
* [ ] $1M per year: It might be time to form a corporation!
