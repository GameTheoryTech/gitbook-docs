### What Are Liquidity Pools?[â€‹](https://docs.sushi.com/docs/Products/Sushiswap/Liquidity%20Pools#what-are-liquidity-pools) <a href="#what-are-liquidity-pools" id="what-are-liquidity-pools"></a>

Liquidity Pools are a place to pool tokens (otherwise known as liquidity) so that users can use them to make trades in a decentralized and permission-less way. These pools are created by users and decentralized apps who want to profit from their usage. To pool liquidity, the amounts a user supplies must be equally divided between two coins: the primary token (sometimes called the quote token) and the base token (usually $AVAX or a stable coin).

Game Theory's liquidity pools allow anyone to provide liquidity to them; when they do so, they will receive trading fees. If a user deposited $GAME and $USDC into a pool, they would receive GAME-USDC SLP tokens. These tokens represent a proportional share of the pooled assets, allowing a user to reclaim their funds at any point. Every time another user uses the pool to trade between $GAME and $USDC, a 0.25% fee is taken on the trade. 0.2% of that trade goes back to the LP pool.

The value of the SLP tokens, which represent the shares of the total liquidity each pool, is updated with each trade to add their value relative to the tokens the pool uses to trade. If previously there were 100 SLP tokens representing 100 $GAME and 100 $USDC, each token would be worth 1 $GAME & 1 $USDC (note in this example, $GAME and $USDC are the same relative value). If a user were then to trade 10 $GAME for 10 $USDC in that pool, and another user were to trade 10 $GAME for 10 $USDC, then there would now be 100.025 $GAME and 100.025 $USDC. This means each LP token would be worth 1.0025 $GAME and 1.00025 $USDC now when it is withdrawn.
