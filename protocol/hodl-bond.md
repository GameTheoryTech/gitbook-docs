# HODL (Bond)

Contract: [0xFfF54fcdFc0E4357be9577D8BC2B4579ce9D5C88](https://ftmscan.com/token/0xFfF54fcdFc0E4357be9577D8BC2B4579ce9D5C88)

The main purpose of HODL is to help incentivize fluctuations in the supply during epoch contraction periods. When the last TWAP (time-weighted average price) of $GAME falls below 1 $DAI, HODL tokens are issued and can be bought with $GAME at the current price. These bonds will be incentivized in various ways, such as staking and special offers. Exchanging $GAME for HODL burns $GAME tokens, taking them out of circulation (deflation) and helps to get the price back up to peg. These HODL tokens can be redeemed for $GAME when the price is above peg in the future, plus a premium based on how high above peg we currently are. This conversely creates inflation and subsequent sell pressure for $GAME when it is above peg, helping to push it back toward 1 $DAI.

{% hint style="info" %}
Unlike early algorithmic protocols, HODL does not have an expiration date.

All HODL holders will be able to redeem their HODL for GAME tokens as long as the treasury has a positive GAME balance, which typically happens when the protocol is in epoch expansion periods.
