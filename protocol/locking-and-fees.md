# Bonus Rewards and Fees

Game Theory is tailored towards long-term holders who want to be shareholders in our ecosystem. To incentivize that we have front-loaded the number of tokens that are distributed each week. That means the emissions will be highest in week one and decrease over time to reward early investors. We also have a long-term bonus for investors who are staking until the launch of Brutal Network with $LTHEORY tokens. These tokens will start vesting one year from the project launch on March 24th, 2023. From then $LTHEORY tokens will vest linearly over the next 365 days being fully vested in March 2024. They also can be unlocked through the purchase and holding of an NFT or through completing quests in Brutal Network.&#x20;

Every week, the ratio of $THEORY to LTHEORY on unclaimed rewards increases by 2%. In week one, 95% of emissions are LTHEORY and 5% are $THEORY. In week two, 93% are LTHEORY and 7% are $THEORY. In week three, 91% are LTHEORY and 9% are $THEORY. This will continue each week until the end of the year when 0% of rewards are LTHEORY and 100% are $THEORY.

### Locks ($GAME Rewards)

There are two different types of $GAME tokens. $GAME and Locked $GAME ($LGAME). The locking mechanism is based on the time-weighted average price (TWAP) of $GAME. The mechanism applies when the TWAP is between $1.01 and $4 and it applies linearly. The locking mechanism only initiates when $GAME rewards are claimed from the Theoretics. When an investor claims their tokens if the TWAP is $4 or higher there is no lock on any $GAME token. If the TWAP is $1.01 then 95% of the $GAME tokens that were claimed would be locked. If the TWAP was $2 when the tokens were claimed then roughly 33% of the tokens would be locked.&#x20;

$LGAME tokens unlock over 365 days linearly. So as soon as someone claims when the TWAP is under $4 and they have $LGAME tokens they would begin to unlock. To turn unlocked $LGAME tokens into $GAME tokens you click on 'my wallet' and hit the 'unlock' button.&#x20;

| TWAP  | Unlocked Tokens | Locked Tokens |
| ----- | --------------- | ------------- |
| 4.0+  | 100%            | 0%            |
| 1.01- | 5%              | 95%           |
|       |                 |               |



### Deposit and Withdraw Fees ($THEORY and $GAME)

**There are no deposit fees for staking your tokens, except the 1% deposit fee for genesis pools.** To protect against flash loans and pump and dumps, and to encourage long-term holding, there are withdrawal fees for withdrawing staked tokens (not during genesis). Each withdrawal resets the fee timer. The withdrawal fees are listed below:

* **0.01%** fee if a user withdraws after **4 weeks.**
* **0.25%** fee if a user withdraws after **2 weeks but before 4 weeks.**
* **0.5%** fee if a user withdraws after **5 days but before 2 weeks.**
* **1%** fee if a user withdraws under **5 days.**
* **2%** fee if a user withdraws under **3 days.**&#x20;
* **4%** fee if a user withdraws under **24 hours.**&#x20;
* **8%** fee if a user withdraws under **1 hour.**
* **25%** slashing fee if a user withdraws **during the same block.**
