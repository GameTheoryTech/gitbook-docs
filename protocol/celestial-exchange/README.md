# Decentralized Exchange

The Game Theory Decentralized Exchange is a peer-to-peer system designed for exchanging cryptocurrencies on the Avalanche blockchain. The protocol is implemented as a set of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts; designed to prioritize censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and to function without any trusted intermediaries who may selectively restrict access.

The Game Theory Decentralized Exchange is sole location where investors can buy and sell $GAME tokens and create and break liquidity pool tokens. On the DEX you can use either $USDC or $AVAX to buy $GAME tokens, as well as form $GAME-$USDC and $GAME-$AVAX liquidity pool tokens.

The Game Theory DEX uses an Automated Market Maker (AMM), sometimes referred to as a Constant Function Market Maker, in place of an order book.

At a very high level, an AMM replaces the buy and sell orders in an order book market with a liquidity pool of two assets, both valued relative to each other. As one asset is traded for the other, the relative prices of the two assets shift, and a new market rate for both is determined. In this dynamic, a buyer or seller trades directly with the pool, rather than with specific orders left by other parties.&#x20;
