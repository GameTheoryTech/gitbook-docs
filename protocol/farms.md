# Farms

To incentivize healthy liquidity pools for the Game Theory protocol tokens, our LP farms have been seeded with THEORY to be distributed as rewards to LP stakers across a time period of 12 months. The total THEORY rewards are distributed from each farm as follows:

* GAME-BTCB LP: 25% of THEORY rewards
* THEORY-BNB LP: 25% of THEORY rewards
* GAME Single Stake: 50% of THEORY rewards
* ~~GAME-THEORY LP: _Deprecated_~~

### **1. What will happen when the circulating supply equals the total supply? Will reward emissions stop?**

Yes. Once the max supply of THEORY (59.5K) is reached, reward emissions end. This will happen in exactly one year from when the THEORY farms started on November 25th, 2021. THEORY will always continue to print GAME in the Boardroom, though, as long as GAME remains above peg.

THEORY reward emissions for the current LP farms are scheduled to end on November 25th, 2022 once the total THEORY supply has been distributed.

### 2. Why is "at-peg" (TWAP between 1.00 and 1.01) the best time to provide liquidity?

When GAME is pegged or close to being pegged at 10,000 GAME to 1 BTC, it is more akin to having exposure to a single asset (single staking) than to your traditional LP'ing experience, where you would run the risk of impermanent loss if one of the tokens went up in value and the other did not.

### 3. Wait, you mean that if BTC pumps, GAME pumps with it?

**Yes!**\
\
Let's look at an example:\
\
If BTC pumps in price, it won't "outrun" GAME, even if nobody is buying GAME at that time.\
\
The farm APRs will vary in terms of USD value, but the emissions won’t. This is something that wouldn't be possible with another 1:1 pegged asset like a stablecoin LP position, where the USD value is directly tied to the emissions. If BTC rises in USD value, GAME goes with it. Similarly, if BTC falls in USD value, GAME will be worth less in USD, **but it won’t affect the peg**.

The only thing that can change the price of GAME in terms of its BTC value (and as such, the peg) is buying and selling it.
