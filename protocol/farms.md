# Farms

To incentivize healthy liquidity pools for the Game Theory protocol tokens, our LP farms have been seeded with $THEORY to be distributed as rewards to LP stakers across a time period of 12 months. The total $THEORY rewards are distributed from each farm as follows:

* $GAME-$DAI LP: 60% of the $THEORY rewards
* $THEORY-$DAI LP: 40% of the $THEORY rewards

### **1. What will happen when the circulating supply equals the total supply? Will reward emissions stop?**

Yes. Once the max supply of $THEORY is reached, reward emissions end. This will happen in exactly one year from when the $THEORY farms started on March 24th 2023. From then on, LP providers will be incentivized in different ways. $THEORY will always continue to print $GAME in the Theoretics, though, as long as $GAME remains above peg.

### 2. Why is "at-peg" (TWAP between 1.00 and 1.01) the best time to provide liquidity?

When $GAME is pegged or close to being pegged, it is more akin to having exposure to a single asset (single staking) than to your traditional liquidity pool experience, where you would run the risk of impermanent loss if one of the tokens went up in value and the other did not. For information on impermanent loss see [here](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained).

THEORY reward emissions for the current LP farms are scheduled to end one year after the start of emissions once the total THEORY supply has been distributed.
