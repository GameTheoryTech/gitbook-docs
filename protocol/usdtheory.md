# $THEORY

Contract: [0x60787C689ddc6edfc84FCC9E7d6BD21990793f06](https://ftmscan.com/token/0x60787C689ddc6edfc84FCC9E7d6BD21990793f06)

The share token ($THEORY) is one of the ways to measure the value of the Game Theory protocol. It represents shareholder trust in its long term vision and ability to maintain the peg of $GAME to 1 $DAI. $THEORY is acquired through the farm by staking in either the $GAME-$DAI or $THEORY-$DAI liquidity pools.&#x20;

There are two types of $THEORY tokens; unlocked $THEORY and locked $THEORY ($L-THEORY).

$THEORY is the governance token of Game Theory. Owning it allows investors to vote on protocol activities including which gaming projects the treasury will invest in. Treasury profits are distributed to $THEORY holders through buybacks of the token and increased liquidity. $THEORY holders will also have priority access to all protocol activities including competitions, partnerships, our expanding NFT marketplace and other protocol features that will be added over time.

$L-THEORY is a bonus that is awarded to long-term investors. $L-THEORY is locked for 365 days from launch until roughly March 25th 2023. From that date all $L-THEORY begins to unlock linearly over the next 365 days. That mean all $L-THEORY will be unlocked by roughly March 25th 2024. There are three ways for an investor to unlock $L-THEORY tokens:

1. Wait 365 days from launch and their tokens will unlock linearly over the next 365 days.
2. Mint an NFT from the treasury. For more information see [NFTs and Marketplace](nfts-and-marketplace.md).
3. Play Brutal Network and complete specific tasks and quests.

When $L-THEORY tokens are unlocked to claim them you go to 'my wallet' and you hit on the claim button to turn the unlocked $L-THEORY tokens into $THEORY tokens.

When farming investors generate both $THEORY and $L-THEORY. The percentage of the total farmed $THEORY tokens relative to $L-THEORY tokens increases every week. Based on the 'rewards locked' number will determine how much of the '$THEORY earned' in the farm is $THEORY and how much is $L-THEORY. There are many strategies investors can employ. The earlier they claim the more $THEORY they can stake in Theoretics or compound in the farm, but the higher percentage of their tokens are $L-THEORY. The longer they wait to claim the more of their tokens are $THEORY compared to $L-THEORY, but they are not farming in the farm or theoretics. The strategy to choose is down to individual investor preference.
