# Locking

To balance the high emissions rates in earlier weeks and to provide price stability, our tokenomics includes a locking model for rewards. A portion of the tokens distributed as rewards is unlocked. Once claimed, these unlocked reward tokens transfer directly into the player's wallet and are immediately usable. However, a portion of the rewards are also locked. These rewards are allocated to the player's wallet, but cannot be accessed or used in any way until they become unlocked.
