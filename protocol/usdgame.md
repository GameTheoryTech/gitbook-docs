**$GAME** is the token of the Game Theory ecosystem. $GAME is the exclusive currency used across the Game Theory ecosystem to power our games, our decentralized exchange, our NFTs, our NFT marketplace and our lottery. Within our ecosystem of blockchain games, the $GAME token is used for credits and to mint all our premium in-game currencies.&#x20;

Long term, the price of $GAME will be a reflection of the value of the Game Theory ecosystem as the more popular all of the products are in the ecosystem, the more there is demand for the $GAME token. Providing liquidity to the $GAME token and holding the governance token $MASTER are the best ways to benefit from the growth of the Game Theory ecosystem long term.&#x20;

$GAME has one initial liquidity pool: $GAME-$USDC

Liquidity providers are incentivized to stake their liquidity pool tokens in our farms to earn rewards in $GAME tokens.

$GAME also has a sales tax that is based on the size of the sale relative to the size of the liquidity pool in order to protect our long-term investors, increase treasury value, and incentivize buyers when we are under our desired health factor. The health factor also increases on buys (and over 30 days) and decreases on sales.

$GAME tokens can be bought from Celestial Exchange with $USDC
