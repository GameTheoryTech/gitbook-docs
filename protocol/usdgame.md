# $GAME

Contract: [0x56EbFC2F3873853d799C155AF9bE9Cb8506b7817](https://ftmscan.com/token/0x56EbFC2F3873853d799C155AF9bE9Cb8506b7817)

**$GAME** is designed to be used as a medium of exchange inside and outside of the protocol and its ecosystem. The built-in stability mechanism in the protocol aims to maintain the peg to 1 $DAI token in the long run. By pegging to a stablecoin $GAME will be able to maintain a stable price over the long term which makes $GAME perfect to be used for an in-game currency for Brutal Network and in the wider ecosystem. During epoch expansions the protocol mints $GAME and distributes it proportionally to all $THEORY holders who have staked their tokens in the [**Theoretics**](theoretics.md). $GAME is designed to be used as currency, with $THEORY representing equity in the protocol.

### **How the Algorithmic Peg works?**

**When $GAME is above peg**

When the price of $GAME is above the price of $DAI ($1), the token supply will continue to increase and will be **distributed** to the $THEORY stakers in [Theoretics](theoretics.md).

There is a locking mechanism in place for the distribution of $GAME. For more information on that, visit the [Locking](locking-and-fees.md) page.

**When $GAME is below peg**

When the $GAME time-weighted average price is below the price of $DAI the token supply will stop increasing and being distributed. At this time token holders can purchase [**HODL**](usdhodl.md) **** with their $GAME tokens which will be burned to reduce the supply and help increase the price. When $GAME is above the price of $DAI you can redeem your HODL tokens for $GAME.

**$GAME Distribution:**

Every epoch $GAME expansion is distributed as follows:

60% of Epoch expansion goes to $THEORY stakers in theoretics.

40% of Epoch expansion goes to treasury for supporting the protocol

| Circulating Supply | Max $GAME Minted |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Bootstrap          | 5% expansion     |
| Up to 500k         | 4.5% expansion   |
| Up to 1M           | 4% expansion     |
| Up to 1.5M         | 3.5% expansion   |
| Up to 2M           | 3% expansion     |
| Up to 5M           | 2.5% expansion   |
| Up to 10M          | 2% expansion     |
| Up to 20M          | 1.5% expansion   |
| Up to 50M          | 1.25% expansion  |
| 50M+               | 1% expansion     |

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that $GAME **actively pegs via an algorithm**, but that **does not mean** it will be valued at 1 $DAI at all times as **it is not collateralized**. $GAME is not to be confused for a crypto or fiat-backed stablecoin.
