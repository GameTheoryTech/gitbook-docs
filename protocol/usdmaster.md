**$MASTER** is the governance token of the Game Theory ecosystem. Owning $MASTER is the most profitable way to participate in Game Theory over the long term.&#x20;



**$MASTER provides:**

\-A higher value than $THEORY due to sharing in the treasuries profits

\-The ability to vote in snapshot governance proposals

\-The ability to print more $GAME tokens from theoretics



**How to obtain $MASTER:**

Go into the Dungeon and you exchange $THEORY tokens for $MASTER tokens.

The amount of $MASTER tokens you receive is based on the price of $MASTER in relation to the price of $THEORY at the time.

The minimum lockup period for $MASTER is 365 days.



**Earning $GAME tokens:**

Once theoretics lockups begin earned $GAME rewards will be claimable every 6 epochs (36 hours)

After the 365 day lockup claiming $GAME rewards will lock up $MASTER for 30 days.&#x20;



**Where $MASTER value comes from:**

$MASTER value is the price of $THEORY plus the profit sharing from the treasury

The profits comes from withdrawal fees from theoretics, sell fees from the NFT marketplace among other fees.&#x20;



**Redeeming $MASTER for $THEORY:**

After 365 days $MASTER can be redeemed for $THEORY

When redeeming $MASTER you would receive the amount of $THEORY initially deposited plus all of the accumulated $THEORY from the treasury profit sharing

Once the redeem request has been initiated depending on the epoch timer it would take up to 6 epochs (36 hours) for your $THEORY to be available to be redeemed. Once the timer is up you can then claim your $THEORY tokens from the Dungeon.&#x20;
