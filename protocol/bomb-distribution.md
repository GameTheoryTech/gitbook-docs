description: How GAME will be distributed upon supply expansion

# GAME Distribution

At the beginning of every epoch, if the time-weighted average price (TWAP) of GAME is greater than 1.01 (ignored the first week, the bootstrap period), new GAME will be minted in the [Theoretics](theoretics.md).

The amount of new GAME distributed depends on our position above peg and also the current circulating supply of GAME.  These numbers may be increased during promotional periods!

| Circulating Supply | Max GAME Minted |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| Bootstrap          | 5% expansion    |
| Up to 500k         | 4.5% expansion  |
| Up to 1M           | 4% expansion    |
| Up to 1.5M         | 3.5% expansion  |
| Up to 2M           | 3% expansion    |
| Up to 5M           | 2.5% expansion  |
| Up to 10M          | 2% expansion    |
| Up to 20M          | 1.5% expansion  |
| Up to 50M          | 1.25% expansion |
| 50M+               | 1% expansion    |
