# NFTs and Marketplace

To incentivize long term holders we have developed the Game Theory NFTs (GT NFT). The NFT will be generated once someone stakes in either of the two farm pools. Every second someone is staked the NFT will be accruing $VEST tokens to the schedule of 1 per hour. Once the NFT has accrued 48 $VEST tokens (2 days staked) the NFT levels up. Each level of NFT enables the investor to unlock an extra 1% of their locked tokens ahead of the vesting schedule. A level 1 NFT would give you a 1% extra unlock. A level 10 NFT would give you an extra 10% unlock. If the investor unstakes then they lose their NFT and they return to the regular vesting schedule. If they restake a new NFT is generated with no $VEST tokens and it begins accruing again.

## Minting NFTs

Another way that investors can acquire an NFT and accelerate their vesting schedule is to mint one with the treasury. Based on the maximum level available that week investors can mint NFTs of different levels by exchanging GAME-DAI LP tokens or THEORY-DAI LP tokens with the treasury. This will help to provide price stability to the protocol through increased liquidity and decreased sell pressure. The price of each NFT will be as follows (prices are subject to change based on market conditions):

|        | Mint Price      | Accepted Payment |
| ------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
| 1-10   | $500-$5,000     | GAME-DAI LP      |
| 11-20  | $5,500-$10,000  | THEORY-DAI LP    |
| 21-30  | $10,500-$15,000 | DAI              |
| 31-40  | $15,500-$20,000 |                  |
| 41-50  | $20,500-$25,000 |                  |
| 51-60  | $25,500-$30,000 |                  |
| 61-70  | $30,500-$35,000 |                  |
| 71-80  | $35,500-$40,000 |                  |
| 81-90  | $40,500-$45,000 |                  |
| 91-100 | $45,000-$50,000 |                  |

## NFT Marketplace

The third way an investor can acquire a GT NFT is through the Game Theory NFT marketplace. This will enable investors to buy and sell GT NFTs. When someone buys an NFT from the marketplace they can compound the NFT into their existing NFT to boost its level up to the maximum level for that week. They can also choose the sell the NFT. For someone that has multiple NFTs the one with the highest level will be used for their vesting schedule acceleration. &#x20;
