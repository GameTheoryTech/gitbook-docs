# NFTs and Marketplace

The Game Theory ecosystem has utility NFTs (non-fungible tokens) that provide value to both the investing and gaming sides of the protocol.



The VIP pass provides the following:

\-Boosts to rewards from the liquidity pool farms (VIP1 provides a 2% boost, VIP2 a 1% boost)

\-Early access to testing and sneak peeks of games

\-In game bonuses and rewards



**Emissions Boost**

Holding the VIP pass gives a boost to rewards from staking LP tokens in the farm

Example: Let's say your emissions earned per day is 100 Game tokens. If you Boost using an Gen 0 (2% boost) then your daily emissions will be 100 \* 1.02 = 102 Game tokens.
