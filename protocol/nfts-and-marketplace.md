# NFTs and Marketplace

To incentivize long term holders we have developed the Game Theory NFTs (GT NFT). The level 1 NFT can be minted from the treasury for 500 $DAI. Every 3 days the NFT has been held it levels up. Each level the NFT increases it gives the ability to unlock that corresponding percentage of $LTHEORY. So a level 1 NFT can unlock 1% of $LTHEORY. A level 10 NFT can unlock 10% of $LTHEORY and so on. So for example if you had 100 $LTHEORY tokens claimed in your wallet and you had a level 50 NFT you could use your NFT on those tokens and unlock 50 of them. The NFT can only be used on those tokens once and no other NFT can interact with those same tokens. This is one of the few ways to turn $LTHEORY tokens into $THEORY and is thus extremely valuable. The NFT greatly increases the benefits of being an early investor in the protocol and being a long term share-holder.

## Minting NFTs

NFTs come in 4 different level brackets that have corresponding colors. Whatever color the NFT is when it is minted it will stay that color regardless of how many levels it increases by.

Levels 1-19 Bronze

## NFT Generations

There are currently two generations of NFTs. Generation 0 and Generation 1. Generation 0 NFTs have the following supply limits: Bronze 100, Silver 30, Gold 15, Platinum 5. Generation 0 NFTs can only be merged with other Generation 0s. They can be merged an unlimited number of times. Every merger lowers the supply further and makes them more valuable on the NFT marketplace.

Generation 1 NFTs have the following supply limits: Bronze 300, Silver 100, Gold 50, Platinum 10. Generation 1 NFTs can only be merged once. They can only be merged with other generation 1 NFTs.&#x20;

## NFT Marketplace

You can also acquire an NFT on the open market through the Game Theory NFT marketplace. This will enable investors to buy and sell GT NFTs using $GAME. Every week there will be a limit to the highest possible level and NFT can have and that will increase over time. When someone buys an NFT from the marketplace they can merge their NFT into an existing NFT to boost its level up to the maximum level available for that week. They can also choose the sell the NFT. For someone that has multiple NFTs if they choose to unlock claimed $LTHEORY tokens in their wallet the NFT with the highest level will be used.
