# NFTs and Marketplace

To incentivize long term holders we have developed the Game Theory NFTs (GT NFT). The level 0 NFT can be minted from the treasury for 100 $DAI. Every 3 days the NFT has been held it levels up. Each level the NFT increases it gives the ability to unlock that corresponding percentage of $LTHEORY. So for example if you had 100 $LTHEORY tokens claimed in your wallet and you had a level 50 NFT you could use your NFT on those tokens and unlock 50 of them. The NFT can only be used on those tokens once and no other NFT can interact with those same tokens. This is one of the few ways to turn $LTHEORY tokens into $THEORY and is thus extremely valuable. The NFT greatly increases the benefits of being an early investor in the protocol and being a long term share-holder.

## Minting NFTs

|       | Mint Price      | Accepted Payment |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| 0-10  | $100-$5,100     | $GAME            |
| 11-20 | $5,600-$10,600  |                  |
| 21-30 | $11,200-$16,200 |                  |
| 31-40 | $16,700-$21,700 |                  |
| 41-50 | $22,200-$27,200 |                  |

## NFT Marketplace

You can also acquire an NFT on the open market through the Game Theory NFT marketplace. This will enable investors to buy and sell GT NFTs using $GAME. Every week there will be a limit to the highest possible level and NFT can have and that will increase over time. When someone buys an NFT from the marketplace they can merge their NFT into an existing NFT to boost its level up to the maximum level available for that week. They can also choose the sell the NFT. For someone that has multiple NFTs if they choose to unlock claimed $LTHEORY tokens in their wallet the NFT with the highest level will be used.
