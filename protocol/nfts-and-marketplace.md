# NFTs and Marketplace

To incentivize long term holders we have developed the Game Theory NFTs (GT NFT). The level 1 NFT can be minted from the treasury for $100 of $GAME. Every 3 days the NFT has been held, it levels up. Each level of NFT enables the investor to unlock an extra 1% of their locked $THEORY tokens ahead of the vesting schedule. A level 1 NFT would give you a 1% extra unlock. A level 10 NFT would give you an extra 10% unlock. The NFT greatly increases the benefits of being an early investor in the protocol and being a long term share-holder.

## Minting NFTs

|       | Mint Price      | Accepted Payment |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| 0-10  | $100-$5,100     | $DAI             |
| 11-20 | $5,600-$10,600  |                  |
| 21-30 | $11,200-$16,200 |                  |
| 31-40 | $16,700-$21,700 |                  |
| 41-50 | $22,200-$27,200 |                  |

## NFT Marketplace

You can also acquire an NFT on the open market through the Game Theory NFT marketplace. This will enable investors to buy and sell GT NFTs. When someone buys an NFT from the marketplace they can merge their NFT into an existing NFT to boost its level up to the maximum level available for that week. They can also choose the sell the NFT. For someone that has multiple NFTs the one with the highest level will be used for their vesting schedule acceleration. The marketplace will use $GAME as its sole currency.
