# THEORY Credits

The sales tax on Celestial Exchange with $GAME tokens has a completely unique feature to incentivize the purchasing on $GAME tokens under $1.

When the price of $GAME is under $1 then there is an additional 10% sales tax added to the dynamic tax. This tax happens in $USDC tokens and are put into a pool. Anyone that buys $GAME tokens when the price is under $1 is given a corresponding amount of credits of THEORY that is a representation of how much of the rewards pool is theirs. Investors get even more rewards for turning those $GAME tokens in liquidity pool tokens and staking them. They get even more rewards still when they lock up those liquidity pool tokens for $MASTER.

Once $GAME is above $1 the THEORY credits can be redeemed for $USDC. This gives a large incentive to people buying $GAME under $1 and creating LP tokens and it gives them a share of the protocols profits paid out in stablecoins.
